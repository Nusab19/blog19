[blog19](https://blog19.pages.dev) is my personal blog—built with [Astro](https://astro.build/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) from the template of [enscribe](https://github.com/jktrn/astro-erudite).

It's from his blogging template, [astro-erudite](https://github.com/jktrn/astro-erudite).

I've modified things for my own liking. But the primary design pattern and structure is mostly the same.
I'm planning to add an on-site editor to write posts.
