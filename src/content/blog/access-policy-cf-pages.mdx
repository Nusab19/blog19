# What is this about?

For those who don't know what **Access Policy** is in Cloudflare Pages, it's a feature that allows you to restrict access to your *preview deployments*.
For teams and organizations, this is a great feature to have, but for personal projects, it can be a bit of a hassle.

But the actual problem is, you can enable this feature while being in the free plan, but you can't disable it without upgrading to a paid plan. Kind of silly, right?


As of today, April 20, 2025, there is no straight forward way to disable the access policy in Cloudflare Pages without upgrading to a paid plan. But there is a workaround.
You can use the Cloudflare API to disable the access policy for your project.

So, instead of jumping between documentation and the Cloudflare dashboard, you can just follow the steps below to disable the access policy in Cloudflare Pages.

# Steps to disable Access Policy in Cloudflare Pages

There are two thing you'll need for this:
1. Your **Account ID**.
2. An API token with the **Account Access** permission.

## How to get your account ID

Go to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/). Look at the URL. It should look something like this:

![dash](https://pwukkkacs0.ufs.sh/f/N8hw91y0X4dS16D5PoRRMI3dxgsNaFC0p9lQbkScwjAWn6zD)

Your account id will look something like this: `6a2784243169ac723308b65ae743e5ca`

Our first step is done.

## How to get the API token?

- Go to the [API Tokens](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens) page.
- Click on ***Create Token***
- Go to the bottom and go with ***Create Custom Token***
